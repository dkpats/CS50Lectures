# CS50Lectures

I am taking Harvard's CS50: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

This repository stores:
- my personal lecture notes
- guided lecture code examples
- projects for the class

The goal is to use Git as much as possible during the courses progress to become familiar with the tool.
