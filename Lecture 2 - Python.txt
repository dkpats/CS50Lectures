Lecture 2 - Python

Python is not a typed language.
Python inludes a type 'NoneType", keyword 'None'
Created name.Py
f strings are an efficient way to pull variables into strings
Python uses indentation (whitespace I think) to know if we are in a codeblock
Python does not need a boolean necessarily for conditional statements, but he didn't go into detail yet.
In if statements, Python syntax is "elif" not "else if"
