Git allows us to more easily track changes in your code.
Makes it easy to collaborate
1 version stored in repository. Both my partner and I can get access to the file, update ourselves, and we can both push our changes to the server.
We can then each PULL changes to access the latest version of the codebase.
Allows us to test changes on branches without affecting the original codebase.
Allows us to revert back to old code if we make changes we don't want.
Goal of lecture is to get used to using Git
